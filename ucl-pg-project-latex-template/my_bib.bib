  abstract = 	 {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.}

abstract = { We tackle the problem of goal-directed graph construction: given a starting graph, finding a set of edges whose addition maximally improves a global objective function. This problem emerges in many transportation and infrastructure networks that are of critical importance to society. We identify two significant shortcomings of present reinforcement learning methods: their exclusive focus on topology to the detriment of spatial characteristics (which are known to influence the growth and density of links), as well as the rapid growth in the action spaces and costs of model training. Our formulation as a deterministic Markov decision process allows us to adopt the Monte Carlo tree search framework, an artificial intelligence decision-time planning method. We propose improvements over the standard upper confidence bounds for trees (UCT) algorithm for this family of problems that addresses their single-agent nature, the trade-off between the cost of edges and their contribution to the objective, and an action space linear in the number of nodes. Our approach yields substantial improvements over UCT for increasing the efficiency and attack resilience of synthetic networks and real-world Internet backbone and metro systems, while using a wall clock time budget similar to other search-based algorithms. We also demonstrate that our approach scales to significantly larger networks than previous reinforcement learning methods, since it does not require training a model. }
